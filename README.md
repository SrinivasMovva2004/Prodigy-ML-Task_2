K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
This repository demonstrates K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score.

Overview
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a specified number of clusters. In this project, we apply K-means clustering to segment customers based on two features:
1.Annual Income: The annual income of customers.
2.Spending Score: A score assigned to customers based on their spending behavior.
The dataset used here is synthetic and consists of 20 customer records.

Files:
Task_2.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for data preprocessing, K-means clustering, and visualization.
Customer.csv: CSV file containing the generated customer dataset used for clustering.

Libraries Used:
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for the K-means algorithm.
matplotlib: Visualization library for plotting the clusters.
